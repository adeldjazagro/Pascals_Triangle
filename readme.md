## About ##

Yet another one of my Intro To C assignments (this one calculates a given row of Pascal's Triangle).

## Building ##

To build, open the Xcode project and select the target you want. The different targets are all named pretty self-explanatorily, so just choose the one you want depending on whether you want separate libraries or not. I haven't written any sort of installer script yet, so you'll just have to copy the headers, libraries, and executables to wherever you want to copy them manually (good choices are /usr/local/bin for the executables, /usr/local/include for the headers, and /usr/local/lib for the libraries).
